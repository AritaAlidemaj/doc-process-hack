# Intelligent Document Processing using Azure AI

Welcome to the Intelligent Document Processing using Azure AI Hackathon! Today, you're set to dive into the transformative world of AI, with a focus on utilizing the power of the Azure AI Platform. Prepare yourself for a day of intense learning, innovation, and hands-on experience that will elevate your understanding of AI integration in application development.


## Introduction
As participants, you will delve into innovative solutions that leverage AI to streamline workflows, reduce human error, and expedite the handling of critical documents. By integrating advanced vision technologies, you will create applications that not only improve operational efficiency but also elevate the overall customer experience at Contoso Bank. 

Prepare to unleash your creativity and technical skills as you embark on this exciting journey to shape the future of the financial services!

## Architecture

The Hackathon will be based on creating an automated document processing workflow using Azure services. When a document is uploaded to an Azure Storage Account, it triggers an Azure Function App that begins by cleaning and preparing the document's content. The data is then structured into a JSON format for further processing. Leveraging AI Document Intelligence, key information is extracted automatically, improving accuracy in data handling. Additionally, Azure OpenAI Service is integrated to transform natural language to a Desired JSON format, allowing the system to further enhance and structure the document's data. Finally, the processed JSON files are stored in Azure Cosmos DB, ensuring scalable and efficient storage for easy access and future use.
