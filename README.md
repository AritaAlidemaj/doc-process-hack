# Intelligent Document Processing using Azure AI

Welcome to the Intelligent Document Processing using Azure AI Hackathon! Today, you're set to dive into the transformative world of AI, with a focus on utilizing the power of the Azure AI Platform. Prepare yourself for a day of intense learning, innovation, and hands-on experience that will elevate your understanding of AI integration in application development.


## Introduction
As participants, you will delve into innovative solutions that leverage AI to streamline workflows, reduce human error, and expedite the handling of critical documents. By integrating advanced vision technologies, you will create applications that not only improve operational efficiency but also elevate the overall customer experience at Contoso Bank. 

Prepare to unleash your creativity and technical skills as you embark on this exciting journey to shape the future of the financial services!

## Architecture

The Hackathon will be based on creating a document processing workflow using Azure services. The process you will create begins when a user uploads a document into an Azure Storage Account, which automatically triggers a workflow. Azure Function App is then activated to extract the contents of the document. The data undergoes a cleaning process and is structured into JSON format. Once the JSON files are created, they are stored in Azure Cosmos DB for future access. The stored data is then vectorized to prepare it for downstream analysis and chatbot interaction. The workflow is supported by Azure AI Search for advanced document searching capabilities and Azure OpenAI Service for enhancing chatbot functionality.

The data that will be used can be of 3 different formats: **Loan Forms, Loan Agreements and Pay Stubs**, and your solution should have the different specificities of each topic into consideration.
## Learning Objectives

By participating in this hackathon, you will learn how to:

- Gain Practical Experience with Azure Technologies
- Develop Competencies in Document Processing
